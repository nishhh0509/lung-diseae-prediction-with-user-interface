Pneumonia
Pneumonia is a contagious infection with symptoms that range from mild (cold and flu-like) to severe. How serious your case of pneumonia is depends on the particular germ causing the pneumonia, your overall health and your age.

What is pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of your lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. When there is an infection in the lungs, several things happen, including:
* Your airways swell (become inflamed)
* The air sacs in the lungs fill with mucus and other fluids
How common is pneumonia?
Approximately 1 million adults in the United States are hospitalized each year for pneumonia and 50,000 die from the disease. It is the second most common reason for being admitted to the hospital -- childbirth is number one. Pneumonia is the most common reason children are admitted to the hospital in the United States. Seniors who are hospitalized for pneumonia face a higher risk of death compared to any of the top 10 other reasons for hospitalization.
Is pneumonia contagious?
Certain types of pneumonia are contagious (spread from person to person). Pneumonia caused by bacteria or viruses can be contagious when the disease-carrying organisms are breathed into your lungs. However, not everyone who is exposed to the germs that cause pneumonia will develop it.
Pneumonia caused by fungi are not contagious. The fungi are in soil, which becomes airborne and inhaled, but it is not spread from person to person.
How is pneumonia spread from person to person?
Pneumonia is spread when droplets of fluid containing the pneumonia bacteria or virus are launched in the air when someone coughs or sneezes and then inhaled by others. You can also get pneumonia from touching an object previously touched by the person with pneumonia (transferring the germs) or touching a tissue used by the infected person and then touching your mouth or nose.
How long do I remain contagious if I have pneumonia?
If you have bacterial pneumonia, you are still considered contagious until about the second day after starting to take antibiotics and you no longer have a fever (if you had one). If you have viral pneumonia, you are still considered contagious until you feel better and have been free of fever for several days.
What causes pneumonia?
Pneumonia can be caused by a wide variety of bacteria, viruses or fungi. Pneumonia is most commonly classified by the type of germ that causes it and by the location where the person became infected.
Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. This type of pneumonia occurs outside of a hospital or other healthcare facility. Causes include:
* Bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia.
* Viruses: Any virus that causes a respiratory tract infection (infections of the nose, throat, trachea [windpipe], and lungs) can cause pneumonia. The viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza) can cause pneumonia.
* Fungi (molds): Pneumonia caused by fungi is the least common as pneumonia. Fungus in the soil in certain parts of the United States can become airborne and cause pneumonia. One example is valley fever.
Hospital-acquired pneumonia develops during a stay in the hospital for another illness. This type of pneumonia can be more serious because the person is already sick and antibiotics typically used may be less effective. Bacteria adapt and change over time when exposed to antibiotics, making them less effective (called antimicrobial resistance). People in hospitals spread their drug-resistant bacteria to others, leading to more severe and difficult-to-treat cases of pneumonia. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators) are at increased risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Long-term care facility-acquired pneumonia occurs in long-term care facilities (such as nursing homes) or outpatient, extended-stay clinics. Like hospitalized patients, drug-resistant bacteria are found in this setting.
Aspiration pneumonia is another type of pneumonia. Aspiration is when solid food, liquids, saliva or vomit go down the trachea (windpipe) and into the lungs instead of going down the esophagus and into the stomach. If you can't cough up these substances, these particles remain in lung tissue and can become infected and pneumonia may develop.

Is it possible to have pneumonia without having a fever?
It's not the norm but, yes, it's possible to have pneumonia with a low fever or even no fever. If this occurs, it's usually in the very young (newborns and infants) and in older adults or adults with a weakened immune system.
What are the complications of pneumonia?
Anyone can experience complications from pneumonia. However, people in high-risk groups are more likely to develop complications, including:
* Breathing difficulties: Pneumonia can make breathing difficult. Pneumonia plus an existing lung disorder (such as COPD, emphysema, asthma) can make breathing even more difficult. Breathing difficulties may require a hospital stay to receive oxygen therapy or breathing and healing assistance with the use of a breathing machine (ventilator).
* Fluid buildup in the lungs (called pleural effusion or "water on the lungs"): Pneumonia can cause a buildup in the fluid between the membranes that line the lungs and the inside of the chest cavity. It is a serious condition that makes breathing difficult. Pleural effusion can be treated by draining excess fluid with a catheter, chest tube or by surgery.
* Bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia): The bacteria that cause pneumonia can leave your lungs and enter your bloodstream, spreading the infection to other organs. This condition is treated with antibiotics.
* Lung abscess. A lung abscess is a pus-filled cavity in the lung that is caused by a bacterial infection. It can be treated by draining the pus with a long needle or removing it by surgery.
What is the outlook for pneumonia?
People who are otherwise healthy often recover quickly when given prompt and proper care. However, pneumonia is a serious condition and can be life-threatening if left untreated and especially for those individuals at increased risk for pneumonia.
Even patients who have been successfully treated and have fully recovered may face long-term health issues. Children who have recovered from pneumonia have an increased risk of chronic lung diseases. Adults may experience:
* Decreased ability to exercise
* Worsening of cardiovascular disease
* Mental decline
* General decline in quality of life for months or years
What can I do to feel better if I have pneumonia?
* Finish all medications and therapies prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking antibiotics when you start feeling better. Continue taking them until no pills remain. If you don't take all your antibiotics, your pneumonia may come back.
* If over-the-counter medicines to reduce fever have been recommended (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen), take as directed on the label. Never give aspirin to children.
* Drink plenty of fluids to help loosen phlegm.
* Quit smoking if you smoke. Don't be around others who smoke or vape. Surround yourself with as much clean, chemical-free air as possible.
* Use a humidifier, take a steamy shower or bath to make it easier for you to breathe.
* Get lots of rest. Don't rush your recovery. It can take weeks to get your full strength back.
If at any time you start to feel worse, call your doctor right away.
When can I return to work, school and regular activities if I have pneumonia?
You typically can resume your normal activities if your symptoms are gone, mild or improving and you do not have new or worsening:
* Shortness of breath or tiredness (less energy)
* Chest pain
* Mucus, fever or cough
If you are generally healthy, most people feel well enough to return to previous activities in about a week. However, it may take about a month to feel totally back to normal.
When should I see a doctor?
Call your doctor if you:
* Have new or worsening:
o Shortness of breath with activities or when lying down
o Fever or cough with mucus
o Tiredness (fatigue)
* Have a change in appetite (less hunger)
* Feel uneasy and know that something is not right
When should I go to the emergency room?
Go to the emergency room or call 911 if you:
* Struggle to breathe or are short of breath while sitting still
* Have new or worsening chest pain
* Are confused or cannot think clearly

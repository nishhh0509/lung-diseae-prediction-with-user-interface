Can pneumonia be prevented or avoided?
There are many factors that can raise your risk for developing pneumonia. These include:
* Your age. People older than 65 are at increased risk because the immune system becomes less able to fight off infection as you age. Infants age 2 or younger are also at increased risk because their immune systems haven't fully developed yet.
* Your environment. Regularly breathing in dust, chemicals, air pollution, or toxic fumes can damage your lungs. This makes your lungs more vulnerable to infection.
* Your lifestyle. Habits such as smoking cigarettes or abusing alcohol can increase your risk. Smoking damages the lungs, while alcohol interferes with how your body fights infection.
* Your immune system. If your immune system is weakened, it's easier for you to get pneumonia because your body can't fight off the infection. This could include people who have HIV/AIDS, have had an organ transplant, are receiving chemotherapy, or have long-term steroid use.
* If you are hospitalized, especially in an ICU. Being in the ICU (intensive care unit) raises your risk of pneumonia. Your risk increases if you are using a ventilator to help you breathe. Ventilators make it hard for you to cough and can trap germs that cause infection in your lungs.
* If you have recently had major surgery or a serious injury. Recovering from major surgery or injury can make it difficult for you to cough. This is the body's quickest defense for getting particles out of the lungs. Recovery also typically requires a lot of bed rest. Lying down on your back for an extended period of time can allow fluid or mucus to gather in your lungs. This gives bacteria a place to grow.
People who have any of the following conditions are also at increased risk:
* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* asthma
* heart disease
* emphysema
* diabetes
* sickle cell disease
You can help prevent pneumonia by doing the following:
* Get the flu vaccine each year. People can develop bacterial pneumonia after a case of the flu. You can reduce this risk by getting the yearly flu shot.
* Get the pneumococcal vaccine. This helps prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria.
* Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Don't smoke. Smoking damages your lungs and makes it harder for your body to defend itself from germs and disease. If you smoke, talk to your family doctor about quitting as soon as possible.
* Practice a healthy lifestyle. Eat a balanced diet full of fruits and vegetables. Exercise regularly. Get plenty of sleep. These things help your immune system stay strong.
* Avoid sick people. Being around people who are sick increases your risk of catching what they have.
Is there a vaccine for pneumonia?
There isn't a vaccine for all types of pneumonia, but 2 vaccines are available. These help prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria. The first is recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age. The second is recommended for anyone age 2 or older who is at increased risk for pneumonia. Getting the pneumonia vaccine is especially important if you:
* Are 65 years of age or older.
* Smoke.
* Have certain chronic conditions, such as asthma, lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, sickle cell disease, or cirrhosis.
* Have a weakened immune system because of HIV/AIDS, kidney failure, a damaged or removed spleen, a recent organ transplant, or receiving chemotherapy.
* Have cochlear implants (an electronic device that helps you hear).
The pneumococcal vaccines can't prevent all cases of pneumonia. But they can make it less likely that people who are at risk will experience the severe, and possibly life-threatening, complications of pneumonia.
